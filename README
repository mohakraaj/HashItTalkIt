TODO:
Place input box at the bottom the page
Clicking without roomname should be blocked


Addrooms button inactivity should be recognised
change navigation hover, active

HashMap is getting updated for all users

Done:
Clear stale user actors
Chat table should only show messages of the room
Clearing all cache when the user enters is wrong, should clear the cache only the person who reenters

Doubts:
